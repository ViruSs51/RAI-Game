Sword on a flat surface. Small grey object sits on white. The smaller rectangle is slightly to the left of the larger rectangle. The rectangle on the bottom has part of rectangle on the top inside it. The rectangle on the top is elongated and the bottom rectangle is square. The top rectangle, 2nd rectangle, is smaller than the first rectangle but bigger than the rectangle on the bottom. The rectangle isn't rectangle shaped but the entire image is not entirely rectangle in shape. Everything in the entire image is rectangle shaped except the main rectangle without the smaller rectangle, the rectangle with the 2 words inside of it, and the white rectangle. There is a white rectangular rectangle, a greysquare with a wavy line through it, a small white rectangle that looks partially like a letter h and a j at the same time and a rectangle with the small rectangle inside of it. The big rectangle is on a square rectangle. The square rectangle is elongated and half is missing at the top. The part missing has no gray rectangle with a wavy line or any other object inside of it. The number 2 underneath the words "Walk" looks like a single letter t on a partially unshaded box. The top of the rectangle where the 4 is in the image is missing like the left side of the rectangle between the 3 text boxes and two rectangle boxes. The wavy striped object on the right rectangle is what makes the 3 text boxes appear to be a figure eight. Is it the objects 4 sides? The  rectangle on the left is the third of three of them when going top to bottom. The rectangle under it at the bottom is half shaded. The large rectangle under it is not fully long & half long for that object.
