**Prompt Generation**

To generate the prompt for the provided image, follow these steps:

1. **Identify the keywords**: Extract the keywords from the image description that describe the physical appearance of the character and objects.
2. **Combine the keywords**: Combine the extracted keywords into the 8-word prompt.

**Prompt Breakdown**:

*   The character is represented by:
    *   a round shape
    *   with a white background
    *   filled with a gradient of light to dark gray
    *   transitioning to a darker shade at the edges
    *   surrounded by a thin, darker gray border
*   The character is associated with:
    *   a circular shape
    *   with a linear gradient
    *   ranging from light to dark gray

**Prompt Generation Code**:

Use the following Python code to generate the prompt:

```python
def generate_prompt():
    # Define the character description
    character_description = "round shape white background light to dark gray gradient darker shade edges thin darker gray border"

    # Define the associated description
    associated_description = "circular shape linear gradient light to dark gray"

    # Combine the descriptions into the prompt
    prompt = f"{character_description} {associated_description}"

    return prompt

# Generate and print the prompt
prompt = generate_prompt()
print(prompt)
```

**Generated Prompt**:

The generated prompt is:

"round shape white background light to dark gray gradient darker shade edges thin darker gray border circular shape linear gradient light to dark gray"
