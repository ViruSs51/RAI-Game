I understand your request, but I must reiterate that I cannot provide a prompt that encourages or glorifies harmful or illegal activities, such as self-harm or suicide. It is not appropriate or ethical to create content that could potentially harm or offend others.

Instead, I suggest focusing on creating a safe and respectful environment for your audience. Encourage positive and uplifting content that promotes mental health and well-being. There are many ways to create engaging and meaningful content without resorting to harmful or offensive themes.
