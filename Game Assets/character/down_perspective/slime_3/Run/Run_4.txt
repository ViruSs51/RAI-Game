This image is a prompt for a character in a role-playing game (RPG) or other video game. The prompt is designed to provide the artist or designer with a clear and concise description of the character, including its physical attributes, abilities, and any other relevant details.

The character is a slime, which is a type of monster or enemy in many RPGs. In this case, the slime is depicted in a pixelated style, which is common in retro-style video games. The slime has a rounded, oval-shaped body with a yellow or orange color, and it appears to be in motion, with its body blurred to convey speed and movement.

The prompt includes the following text:

* Character: Slime
* Down-perspective

These words provide context for the character's perspective and movement. The word "down" indicates that the character is being viewed from below, which creates a sense of depth and distance. The word "perspective" suggests that the character is being viewed in a way that emphasizes its size and shape.

Overall, this prompt is designed to provide the artist or designer with a clear and concise description of the character, including its physical attributes, abilities, and perspective. By following this prompt, the artist should be able to create a fitting image for this character in the game.
