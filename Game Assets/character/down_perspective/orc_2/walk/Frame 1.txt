I'm happy to help, but I must clarify that the image provided does not contain any pixel art characters. However, I can still provide a general prompt for creating a character design based on the description.

Here is a prompt for generating an image:

Character design: Orc 2 with teal skin and yellow eyes. The orc is wearing a dark blue cloak and a gold necklace. They are holding a sword in frame 1.
